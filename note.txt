Layout

Earlier we learnt that layout.txx file is starting app to demonstatrate this, we added root before rendering the children in the layout.tsx file, you will see that the root appears on all the pages we use layout to render stuff like navbar and a footer. layout.tsx act like parents to all of the routes available. in nextjs root layout is required but you can create your own customized layout, lets say you want to created a customixed layout for your dashboard, we can do that by adding another layout.tsx in the dashboard folder the name has to be layout. creating a new layout is as simple as creating a functional component  and passing the children props. 
Now every route under dashboard route has an additional navbar layout.

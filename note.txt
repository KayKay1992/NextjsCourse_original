Data Fetching

Our traditional way of fetching content is using a useEffect.
there is a more efficient way 
a. you declare a new functional component.
b. and immediately at the top of it you make a fetch request.
c. you check if it fails
d. if it doesnt you simply declare it.
e. and set the res.json
f. you map over it in return and displays it.

serverside fetching improves initail load time i.e it loads faster.
it offers better SEOs i.e search engine opimization.
server side fetching offers simplified logic.
it also stops duplicating request from being made
improved security because api calls are done on the server.
Even if javascript is turned off in the browser server side fetching will still work.

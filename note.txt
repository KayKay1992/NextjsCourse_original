Static Site Generation (SSG)

Atechnique where html are generated,this means the content is created when you deploy your site not when you user requested, it can be extremely fast and can be served from a cdn but it is not suitable for website that is frequently ubdated content by default nextjs uses a static rendering stratagy.the result is catched and delivered and can be pushed to a content delivery network(cdn ) ideally ypu use this strategy for blogs, documentation sites but in many cases you have to go for incremental static regneration (isr), it is an extension of ssg that allows you to update static content after you must have built your site. they combine the benefit of ssg with ability to refresh your site.

if you want to use the isr strategy you can do this in two ways, the first one is time based revalidation, you can revalidate your entire page after some time by simply exporting a varible called revalidate and set it the number of seconds you want it to revalidate. 

the second one is to revalidate your request after some time.

React Server components .
These are components that are rendered and their html/css output is rendered in client side. Since they are rendered on the serever they can access server side resources directly like database and the file sysytem this helps to reduce the amount of javascript sent to the client improving performance.

Why cant everything now be server side component since they are of great imortance. if your component involves button and everyother interactivity then we need also a client side component.

What are react Client Component ?
they are components that are rendered in client side. in this case client side simply means the browser to use them in Next.js you must add a use client directive at the top of the project. 
So we created a new folder in app folder called component folder then we created a new file which is hello.tsx to test the client component 
use the component in page.tsx and you will find out that when you run your terminal, the hello component will be rendered in both in server side (terminal) and client side(browser/console.) due to the hydrating ability. that means everything on the client side that doesnt require interactivity(like button, search function) is still run on the server side. this is what is referered to as server side rerendring in Nextjs.

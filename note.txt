ERROR HANDLING.

This catches error and displays it in the ui. similar to how we created multiple layout files we can do the same for error.tsx files 
only the closest error file takes priority you can set error for a each route or you can create a a globalerror handler. 

LOADING UI: 
it works similarly to error handling, you want to show some loading effect in the ui
